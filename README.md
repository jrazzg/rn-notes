# rn-notes
A simple notes app built with React Native to practice navigation, state management, and local data persistence.

## Features
- View, add, edit notes
- Notes shared across screens with Context API
- Data stored in local state, then persisted with AsyncStorage
- Navigation using React Navigation (Stack)

## Learning Goals
- React Navigation basics
- Passing params between screens
- Using Context API for global state
- Storing data locally with AsyncStorage
- Practicing folder structure (screens/, components/, utils/)

## Screens
- Home → list of notes
- Add Note → create new notes
- View/Edit Note → update existing notes
